# Node-local tool cache and dependency caches shared by the runner pods.
#
# Every job used to start in an empty pod and rebuild the same things on the one
# VPS disk: setup-node downloaded Node, subosito downloaded the Flutter SDK, pub
# and npm pulled their packages from the GitHub cache over the internet. On bld1
# that was 6.7% (setup-node) and 9.1% (Flutter) of all runner pod-minutes over
# 2026-10-05..07, and the disk sat at its ~1.5k writes/s ceiling.
#
# The runner takes its tool cache from RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE (actions/runner
# HostContext.cs); setup-node looks there first (tc.find → <tool>/<ver>/<arch> +
# <arch>.complete) and subosito skips the download when
# <cache>/flutter/stable-<ver>-x64/flutter/bin/flutter exists. A version that is
# not preinstalled here is downloaded once by the first job and kept.
#
# npm (cacache: lockless, verified on read) and pub (download to a temp dir, then
# rename) are safe to share between concurrent pods. So is the Dart analyzer
# result cache (FileByteStore: temp file + rename); the analyzer plugin directory
# is not — it is recompiled in place on every start — and stays per pod.
