# Per-container CPU/memory requests. These bound the scheduler so it never
# overpacks the node — without them a container is "weightless" → CPU contention
# → dind's managed containerd misses its 15s startup window → dind exits 1,
# runner hangs Running (1/2 Error forever), build times climb. The dind container
# is the one that runs dockerd + that managed containerd (and every
# `docker build`), so it MUST carry its OWN request — a requested runner sitting
# next to a weightless dind still lets the scheduler overpack dind and starve
# containerd at startup. Sized from p90 of live builds (runner 1.6 cores / 0.9Gi).

# `Handler timeout`, kubelet reported `PLEG is not healthy`, and the node flapped
# NotReady long enough for the taint manager to evict the ARC listeners and for
# the kernel OOM killer to take arc-gha-rs-controller (exit 137). With no
# listener GitHub has nowhere to place jobs, and CI queues silently — the exact

# container sat under its own 4-core cap — the whole 14.8 was in the uncapped
